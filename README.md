# Project Description: Blazor Auto

## Project Name
**Blazor Auto**

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) and Blazor Server  
- **Backend:** .NET 8  
- **API Communication:** HTTPClient, gRPC (optional)  
- **Architecture:** Modular architecture with support for Dependency Injection and Clean Architecture  

---

## Objective
Blazor Auto aims to provide a flexible platform that can operate in both **Blazor Server** and **Blazor WebAssembly (Client)** modes. It is designed to maximize performance, maintainability, and code reusability across hosting models.

---

## Key Features

### âœ… Dual Hosting Support
Seamless switching between Server and Client modes with minimal configuration changes. Business logic and services remain the same across both modes.

### ðŸ”„ Smart API and Service Calls
Abstracts communication between the frontend and backend. Automatically determines the environment (server/client) and chooses the appropriate calling mechanism (direct service call or HTTP request).

### ðŸ§© Integrated Dependency Injection (DI)
Services can be injected into components regardless of the hosting model, promoting a clean separation of concerns and easier testing.

### ðŸ“¦ Modular Design for Maintainability
The project is structured into independent and reusable **modules** (e.g., Auth, Product, Order, User).  
Each module contains its own:
- Pages / UI Components  
- Business Logic (Services)  
- Data Models  
- Routing Configuration  

This modular approach allows teams to:
- Develop and test features in isolation  
- Easily scale and maintain the system  
- Onboard new developers more quickly  

---

## Benefits
- Code reusability across WebAssembly and Server hosting  
- Simplified API/service usage through automatic context detection  
- Faster development through modular code organization  
- Lower maintenance cost and higher scalability  

---

## Target Users
Perfect for development teams or businesses building management systems, e-commerce platforms, or SaaS (Software as a Service) products using Blazor that require flexibility and maintainability.
